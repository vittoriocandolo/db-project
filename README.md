# DB Project
This repo is for a database lab project for my course at Universit√† degli Studi di Udine.  
Content is in Italian.

The project is done using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), Python, R and some Bash.

Starting from user specification a relational database system is built.  
A detailed report is also produced.
